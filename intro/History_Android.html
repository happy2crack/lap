  <h1>History of Android</h1> 
  </div>
 <div data-role="content">
<span style="color: #0000bf;">In 2003, <span style="color: #0060bf;">Android Inc.</span></span> was established by <span style="color: #0060bf;">Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears and Chris White</span>. These four founders worked to create an operating system for mobile devices which could be aware of both a userâ€™s location and their personal preferences. At first, the Android team wanted to implement the system into digital camera devices, creating cameras which could access computer services. However, the company recognized that there would be low demand for such a computer camera, so the development activities switched to a focus on cellular phones.<br><br><span style="color: #0000bf;">In August 2005</span>, Google acquired Android Inc. Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007 with some ground-breaking ideas including multitouch and an open market for applications. Android was quickly adapted to include these features and to offer definite distinctions, such as more control for developers and multitasking.<br><br><span style="color: #0060bf;">At Google</span>, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, released in October, 2008.
