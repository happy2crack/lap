<div data-role="content">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Android </strong>is a mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel and developed by Google. </li>
	<li>With a UI based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). </li>
	<li>The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. </li>
	<li>Android's source code is released by Google under open source licenses, although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software. </li>
	<li>Initially developed by Android, Inc., which Google backed financially and later bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA).</li>
	<li>Android is popular with technology companies which require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices. </li>
	<li>Android's open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which add new features for advanced user or bring Android to devices which were officially released running other operating systems.</li>
