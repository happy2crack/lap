<ul>
	<li><strong>Android SDK:</strong> Android SDK contains tools and utilities to create, compile, test and package Android applications. </li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android SDK Manager:</strong> It is used to download Android SDK Packages.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android Virtual Device Manager:</strong> It is used to create, edit and Manage AVDs. AVD allows a developer to host various emulators, each running on a specific Android Version with specific screen resolution, RAM and SD Card storage specification etc.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android Emulator:</strong> It is a virtual mobile device that runs on your computer. The emulator lets you develop and test Android applications without using a physical device.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android Application Development IDE:</strong> Android Application Developer can use Eclipse IDE or Google provided Android Studio IDE  which based on the IntelliJ IDE.</li><br>

	<li><strong>Dalvik Virtual Machine:</strong> Android Applications are run by a custom VM called Dalvik Virtual Machine. DVM is more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance. In mobile phones, each application runs on its own sand box and thus each active application requires its own DVM instance.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android debug bridge (adb):</strong> Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command line tool that lets you communicate with an emulator instance or connected Android-powered device.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Dalvik Debug Monitor Server:</strong> Android ships with a debugging tool called the Dalvik Debug Monitor Server (DDMS), which provides port-forwarding services, screen capture on the device, thread and heap information on the device, logcat, process, and radio state information, incoming call and SMS spoofing, location data spoofing, and more.
	<br>DDMS is integrated into Eclipse / Android Studio and is also shipped in the tools/ directory of the SDK. DDMS works with both the emulator and a connected device.</li><br>
