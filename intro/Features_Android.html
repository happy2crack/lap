  <h1>Features Of Android</h1> 
  </div>
<div data-role="content">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Multiprocessing:</strong> The Android OS does not restrict the processor to a single application at a time.The system manages priorities of applications and threads within a single application.This has the benefit that background tasks can be run while a user engages the device in a foreground process. </li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Touch and Multitouch:</strong>The touchscreen is an intuitive user interface for a hand-held device. If utilized well, it
can transcend a need for detailed instructions. After a finger touches the screen, drags and flings are natural ways to interact with graphics. Multitouch provides a way to track more than one finger down at the same time.This is often used to zoom or rotate a view.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>App Widgets:</strong> App Widgets are mini applications that can be embedded in other applications (such as the Home screen).They can process events, such as start a music stream or update the outside temperature, while other applications are running.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Google Cloud Messaging:</strong> GCM is a service that lets developers send short message data to their users on Android devices, without needing a proprietary sync solution.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Hardware Access:</strong>The Android SDK includes APIs for location-based hardware (such as GPS), the camera, audio, network connections, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensors (including accelerometers), NFC, the touchscreen, and power management.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Android provides rich support for transferring data between devices, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
Direct, and Android Beam. Android Beam is a popular NFC-based technology that lets users instantly share, just by touching two NFC-enabled phones together.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> In Android Devices, SQLite, a lightweight relational database, is used for data storage purposes. Applications take advantage of this managed relational database engine to store data securely and efficiently.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Media and Graphics Support:</strong> Android provides libraries for handling images, video and audio files, that support formats like H.263, H.264, MPEG-4 SP, AMR, AMR-WB, AAC, HE-AAC, AAC 5.1, MP3, MIDI, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP.</li><br>
