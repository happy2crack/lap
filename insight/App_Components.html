  <h1>App Components</h1> 
  </div>
<div data-role="content">

	App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. 
	
	<br><br>Below are the four types of app components:
<ul>	
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">Activity:</span></strong>
	<br>  An activity represents a single screen with a user interface. </li><br>
	
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">Service:</span></strong>
	<br>   A service is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. A service does not provide a user interface. </li><br>

	<li><strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">Content Providers:</span></strong>
	<br>    A content provider manages a shared set of app data. You can store the data in the file system, an SQLite database, on the web, or any other persistent storage location your app can access. Through the content provider, other apps can query or even modify the data (if the content provider allows it). </li><br>

	<li><strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">Broadcast Receivers:</span></strong>
	<br>   A broadcast receiver is a component that responds to system-wide broadcast announcements. Although broadcast receivers don't display a user interface, they may create a status bar notification to alert the user when a broadcast event occurs.</li><br>
</ul>

Activities, services, and broadcast receivers are activated by an asynchronous message called an intent.

<br><br>For activities and services, an intent defines the action to perform and may specify the URI of the data to act on.

<br><br>For broadcast receivers, the intent simply defines the announcement being broadcast.

<br><br>Content provider, is not activated by intents. Rather, it is activated when targeted by a request from a ContentResolver.
