<ul>
	<li>The <strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">entire lifetime</span></strong> of an activity happens between the call to onCreate() and the call to onDestroy(). Activities perform setup of "global" state (such as defining layout) in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in onDestroy().</li><br>
	
	<li>The <strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">visible lifetime</span></strong> of an activity happens between the call to onStart() and the call to onStop(). During this time, the user can see the activity on-screen and interact with it. The system might call onStart() and onStop() multiple times during the entire lifetime of the activity, as the activity alternates between being visible and hidden to the user.</li><br>
	
	<li>The <strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">foreground lifetime</span></strong> of an activity happens between the call to onResume() and the call to onPause(). During this time, the activity is in front of all other activities on screen and has user input focus. An activity can frequently transition in and out of the foreground.</li><br>
</ul>
