  <h1>Android Development Tools</h1> 
  </div>
<div data-role="content">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Android SDK:</strong> Android SDK (Software Development Kit) contains tools and utilities to create, compile, test and package Android applications. </li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android SDK Manager:</strong> It is used to download Android SDK Packages.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android Virtual Device Manager:</strong> It is used to create, edit and Manage AVDs. AVD allows a developer to host various emulators, each running on a specific Android Version with specific screen resolution, RAM and SD Card storage specification etc.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android Emulator:</strong> It is a virtual mobile device that runs on your computer. The emulator lets you develop and test Android applications without using a physical device.
	<br>The Android emulator mimics all of the hardware and software features of a typical mobile device, except that it cannot place actual phone calls. It provides a variety of navigation and control keys, which you can "press" using your mouse or keyboard to generate events for your application. It also provides a screen in which your application is displayed, together with any other active Android applications. </li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android debug bridge (adb):</strong> Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command line tool that lets you communicate with an emulator instance or connected Android-powered device. It is a client-server program that includes three components:</strong>
        <br>A client, which runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a shell by issuing an adb command. Other Android tools such as the ADT plugin and DDMS also create adb clients.
	<br>    A server, which runs as a background process on your development machine. The server manages communication between the client and the adb daemon running on an emulator or device.
	<br>    A daemon, which runs as a background process on each emulator or device instance.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Android Application Development IDE:</strong> Android Application Developer can use Eclipse IDE or Google provided Android Studio IDE  which based on the IntelliJ IDE.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Dalvik Debug Monitor Server:</strong> Android ships with a debugging tool called the Dalvik Debug Monitor Server (DDMS), which provides port-forwarding services, screen capture on the device, thread and heap information on the device, logcat, process, and radio state information, incoming call and SMS spoofing, location data spoofing, and more.
	<br>DDMS is integrated into Eclipse / Android Studio and is also shipped in the tools/ directory of the SDK. DDMS works with both the emulator and a connected device.</li><br>
	
	<li><strong>Dalvik Virtual Machine:</strong> Android Applications are run by a custom VM called Dalvik Virtual Machine. DVM is the software that runs the applications on Android devices. It is open source. DVM is more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance. In mobile phones, each application runs on its own sand box and thus each active application requires its own DVM instance.
	
	<br>Java compiler complies Java source code into .class files. Then dx (dexer) tool, which is a part of the Android SDK,  processes the .class files into .DEX files that contains Dalvik bytecode.

	<br>DVM runs .Dex file (Dalvik Executable File).
	
	<br>.Dex files and other resources of an Android application project, e.g., the images and XML files etc. are packed into an .apk (Android Package) file by program named AAPT(Android Asset Packaging Tool).
	
	<br>The resulting .apk file contains all necessary data to run the Android application and it is the one which is uploaded at various Android Application Markets for Users.</li><br>
